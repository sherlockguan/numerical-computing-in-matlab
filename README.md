# numerical-computing-in-matlab
review of numerical method of computing in matlab Ax = b<br /> 
major topics:<br /> 
1.solving Ax = b by guass elimination, LU factorization (in raw mathod);<br />
2. root finding : newton's method(taylor's series approximation) , bisection method, secant method(modified on newton's method), built-in-func: roots<br /> 
3. solving nonlinear systems of equation by combining  newton's method and jacobian matrix<br /> 
4. ODE, PDE solved by build in function: dsolve ..or numerical approximation ODE23 ODE45<br /> 
5. FFT, laplace transform etc <br />

## MOST IMPROTANT COMMAND
doc xxx<br />
whos: check the properties of symbolic variables

## NOTICE
some functions or commands have changed in later versions of matlab, check the doc
